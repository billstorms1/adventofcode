advent of code challenge

This is an online code challenge I'm taking for funsies and practice. 

**ADDEMUP**
Day one was taking a large set of both positive and negative integers and summing the total. I just did this in a C# console app and wrote a couple of unit tests. The second half of day one recording the change as each number in the chain was summed to the pevious total and then determining the first value to be repeated.
